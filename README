Adminish requires pagingish resources, formish resources and flash-message resource



Have a look at the example project, adminish-example. The example project should run by setting up a couchdb server. Including a bunch of requirements in parralel (e.g. both this project and it's requirements all under a single directory). and running the following

./recreate-database.sh
./serve.sh

Here are the current requirements which should all be fetched from github (http://github.com/ish/<name>
Packages marked by a + are in pypi. Packages marked with a * are all you need to suck the rest in.


adminish*! (when this ends up in pypi it will suck everything above in)
    pagingish+!
    wsgiapptools+

    couchish*!
        couchdb-session+!
        jsonish+!

    restish*

    formish*
        schemaish+
        validatish+
        convertish+

At some point, before April 2009 hopefully, all of these modules will be eggified and uploaded to PyPI .

THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY CODE YET. BE WARNED.
