* add a default user somehow
* add an index by default or don't show the search box if there are no indexes

Review use of class attributes on resources. I don't think label and template

Review use of ItemsPage.item_resource ... I don't think it's accessible because
there's a template match that would bypass it on the Adminish resource.
